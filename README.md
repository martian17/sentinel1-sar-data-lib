# sentinel1-sar-data-lib

This linrary can be used to decode Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data generated by the Sentinel 1 satellite launched by the European Space Agency.
The end goal is to generate the resulting image with fourier convolution filtering,
but for now I have only implemented the binary struct decoder for the header.
The body data decoder, which decodes the sensor data, in in WIP.
